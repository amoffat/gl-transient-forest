# Asset Licenses

Use this file to track third party assets that you use in your level. Ideally, all assets should be public domain or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/). Other Creative Commons licenses are also acceptable, but none that are Share Alike ("SA") or Non-commercial ("NC") because they limit our ability to publish the level.

If you purchased the assets from an asset store, like Itch.io, you need to ensure that the licensing terms comply with our [Level Submission License Agreement](../docs/License.md).

If you do not include an asset in this file, it is understood that it is an original work of yours that you are licensing to us in accordance with the Level Submission License Agreement.
