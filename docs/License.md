**(v1.5 – Effective 3/20/25)**

This Level Submission License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between Get Me In RN LLC (“Company”) and the individual or entity (“Submitter”) submitting a level (“Level”) for use in the Company’s game platform.

By submitting a Level to the Company (through GitHub or any other means), Submitter agrees to the following terms:

## 1. Grant of Rights

Submitter hereby grants Get Me In RN LLC, its affiliates, licensees, successors, and assigns an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual license to:

- Use, copy, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works of, publicly display, perform, distribute, license, sublicense, sell, commercialize, host, stream, and otherwise exploit the Level in any medium or format, now known or later developed, for any purpose, including commercial use.

This grant includes, without limitation, the right to integrate the Level into the Company’s games and related services, including but not limited to the game currently titled _Get Lost_, as well as promotional materials, monetization platforms, third-party services, or future derivative projects.

Submitter acknowledges that this license is granted on a non-revocable basis and cannot be withdrawn once submitted.

## 2. Ownership, Moral Rights Waiver, and No Obligation to Credit

Submitter retains ownership of any copyrights in the Level but agrees that:

- The Company is not required to provide credit, attribution, or notice to the Submitter in any use or distribution of the Level.
- The Company may modify, repackage, or distribute the Level without notice.
- Submitter waives and agrees not to assert any moral rights or similar rights under the laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the Company’s use of the Level.

## 3. Warranties and Representations

Submitter represents and warrants that:

- The Level is the Submitter’s original work and does not infringe upon any copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, trade dress, moral rights, contract, or any other rights of any third party.
- The Level does not contain any trademarks, logos, brand names, trade dress, or other identifiers owned by third parties without express written permission.
- The Level does not include the name, likeness, voice, or other identifiable attributes of any real person without proper legal consent.
- Submitter has obtained all necessary rights, licenses, permissions, and releases for any third-party content (e.g., music, images, code, characters, dialogue, names, likenesses, assets) included in the Level.
- The Level does not contain any material that is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, harmful, or otherwise objectionable.
- Submitter is at least 18 years old or has obtained consent from a parent or legal guardian and has the legal authority to enter into this Agreement.
- The Level is not generated wholly or substantially by automated means (e.g., AI tools) without appropriate rights to use and license such output.
- The Level does not contain confidential or proprietary information obtained through employment, contractor work, or other agreements with third parties, and does not violate any nondisclosure or non-compete obligations.
- Submitter is not located in a country subject to U.S. government sanctions and is not listed on any U.S. government restricted party list.

## 3A. Third-Party and Creative Commons Content

- Submitter shall disclose in writing any third-party content included in the Level that is licensed under a Creative Commons or other open license. This disclosure must include the license type, original author(s), source link(s), and any attribution requirements applicable to the included content.

- Submitter represents and warrants that any such third-party content complies with this Agreement and does not impose obligations that would conflict with the rights granted herein. The Submitter agrees that inclusion of such content does not limit the Company’s ability to exercise its rights under this Agreement.

- The Company may include attribution for Creative Commons content where legally required, in a manner appropriate to the medium. However, the Company is not required to provide prominent, individualized attribution unless explicitly mandated by the license.

- The Submitter agrees not to include in any Level:

  - Any content licensed under a ShareAlike license (e.g., CC BY-SA, GNU GPL) that would require the Level, game, or any derivative work to be licensed under the same or a compatible license;
  - Any content licensed under a NoDerivatives license (e.g., CC BY-ND), unless the content is included unmodified and used solely in a way that does not constitute a derivative work or adaptation under applicable law;
  - Any content licensed under a NonCommercial license (e.g., CC BY-NC), which would prohibit commercial use by the Company;
  - Any other license terms that would restrict the Company’s ability to sublicense, modify, distribute, or commercially exploit the Level under the terms of this Agreement.

- The Company reserves the right to reject or remove any Level that includes third-party content with licensing terms deemed incompatible with this Agreement, at its sole discretion.

## 3B. Commercial Asset Licensing by Submitters

- Submitter represents and warrants that any third-party asset acquired from a marketplace or other source for inclusion in the Level was purchased with a license that permits commercial use, inclusion in video games, and transfer or sublicensing to the Company as described in this Agreement.

- Where an asset license does not clearly allow redistribution, transfer, or sublicensing, Submitter agrees to either: (a) obtain express written permission from the original licensor for such use; or (b) ensure that the purchase was made explicitly on behalf of the Company and includes a right of use by the Company.

- Submitter shall retain and provide upon request copies of any third-party license documentation and proof of purchase relevant to the Level submission.

- If the asset requires attribution, Submitter must disclose the necessary credit details so that the Company may comply with the attribution terms where legally required.

- The Company reserves the right to reject any Level submission containing assets with unclear or restrictive licensing terms, or to remove such content at a later time if deemed noncompliant.

- In the absence of disclosure by the Submitter that an asset originates from a third-party source, the Company may reasonably rely on the Submitter's warranties and representations that the Level and all of its components are original works by the Submitter or fully licensed to the Company in accordance with this Agreement.

## 4. Indemnification

Submitter agrees to fully defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Get Me In RN LLC, its officers, employees, affiliates, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, or expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or related to:

- Any alleged or actual infringement or misappropriation of third-party rights,
- Any breach of Submitter’s warranties,
- Any claims that the Level violates applicable law,
- Any damages, penalties, settlement amounts, or legal costs arising from the Company’s commercial use, sale, or exploitation of a Level that violates the terms of this Agreement or applicable laws or rights.

This obligation survives termination of this Agreement.

## 5. No Compensation

Submitter acknowledges that no compensation, royalty, or remuneration of any kind is due or payable by the Company in connection with the submission or use of the Level.

## 6. No Obligation to Use; Moderation Rights

The Company is under no obligation to use, host, publish, or distribute the submitted Level. The Company may reject or remove the Level at its sole discretion and without notice, including for violations of community guidelines, terms of service, or legal requirements.

## 7. Submission via Third-Party Platforms

Submission of a Level through any third-party platform or service (e.g., GitHub) shall not alter the rights granted under this Agreement.

## 8. Takedown Procedures

The Company complies with applicable takedown procedures and may remove Levels in response to valid claims of infringement or other legal claims.

## 9. Updated Submissions

## 10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho, United States, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts located in Kootenai County, Idaho.

## 11. Severability
